I am super new to to jailbreaking and sideloading. I've done this before on my samsung but I only installed apks. I want to jailbreak my iphone 7+ but I dont know what im doing. I just want to install more apps then only having a limit of 3. I understand how to sideload and I did install alt store. But the issue is that I need my pc to refresh the alt store or activate another app. I know what Cydia is and I want to install that on my phone. I have no choice but to jailbreak. I recently just found out that there is no jail break for ios 15.7 and I have to use Palera1n. 
There is so many toturials and half of them are scams. I just cant find a good one. Can someone please provide me a good tutorial on how to jailbreak and install Cydia  after? I have an iPhone 7+ and it has 32gb storage on it. Will give the model number if needed.
I lied I have jailbreaked my wii U... I will keep trying to find a tutorial on this topic until I get a responce
Thanks alot!!!!!!
